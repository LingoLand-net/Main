# Our Story
LingoLand was founded with the vision of revolutionizing English language education in Tunisia. Our journey began when <b>Bessem Mbarek,</b> a passionate English teacher, along with a group of technology enthusiasts recognized the need for innovative, engaging, and effective English teaching resources. Since our inception, we have been dedicated to creating materials that not only align with the official Tunisian curriculum but also incorporate the latest advancements in educational technology and pedagogy.
